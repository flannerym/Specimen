# What Is a Herbarium Specimen?

A plant cutting placed between pieces of paper and pressed until it is dried and flattened is an example of a herbarium specimen, in this case, *Pityopsis graminifolia*.  A herbarium is a collection of such sheets.

Two specimens of *Magnolia grandiflora* collected more than 100 years apart.  There is much more information on the later sheet.

There are many elements found on herbarium sheets, though no one sheet is likely to have all of them.  The most common ones are, of course, a label and a plant specimen.  There is usually a stamp for the institution where the sheet is found and sometimes a barcode, that serves as identification for an online version of the sheet.

There are many elements found on some but not all specimens.  If the plant name changed, there will be a revised name on what is called a determination slip.  There may also be a fragment packet
